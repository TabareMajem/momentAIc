Version 1.0  |  February 2026  
*Powered by Nano Banana Pro  |  Kling AI  |  HeyGen  |  Veo 3.1  |  Sora 2  |  ElevenLabs*

# **1\. The Vision: AI Characters That Sell While You Sleep**

Imagine this: you launch a new app. Instead of spending $50K on influencer partnerships and months building an audience, you spin up 5 AI characters in MomentAIc, each targeting a different demographic. Within 48 hours, they’re posting platform-native UGC content across Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X, and LinkedIn. Within 2 weeks, three of them have gone viral. Within 30 days, they’ve driven 10,000 app installs at a fraction of the CAC of paid ads.

This is the AI Character Factory: a new MomentAIc module that combines AI-generated virtual influencers with the autonomous agent architecture from v2.0. Each character is managed by a dedicated agent team that handles everything from content ideation to posting, engagement, trend-riding, A/B testing, and funnel optimization, all running on heartbeats with zero daily human input required.

## **1.1 Why AI Characters Win in 2026**

* **20%+ of top-performing influencer accounts are already synthetic:** AI-generated creators are mainstream. Brands like Prada and Samsung work with virtual influencers like Lil Miquela and Imma who have millions of followers.

* **UGC outperforms brand content by 4x:** User-generated content drives higher engagement and conversion than polished brand ads. AI characters create authentic-feeling UGC at infinite scale.

* **Short-form video dominates every platform:** TikTok, Reels, Shorts, and now LinkedIn video. The tools to generate this content autonomously (Kling, Veo 3.1, Sora 2\) just became production-ready.

* **Character consistency is solved:** Nano Banana Pro and Kling Avatar now maintain perfect face/identity consistency across hundreds of images and videos. The technical barrier to believable virtual influencers has collapsed.

* **Cost advantage is 50-100x:** A human UGC creator costs $500-5,000 per video. An AI character generates unlimited variations for pennies per piece.

## **1.2 The MomentAIc Advantage**

Standalone tools like MakeUGC, HeyGen, or SynthLife handle parts of this. But none of them connect character creation to autonomous social management to customer acquisition funnels to business analytics. MomentAIc’s agent architecture makes this possible because:

* **Agents manage characters autonomously:** The SocialMediaAgent, ContentStrategyAgent, and ViralGrowthAgent from v2.0 already exist. They just need character-aware capabilities.

* **Heartbeats drive continuous posting:** Characters don’t sleep. Their agents wake up on heartbeats, check trending topics, generate content, and post at optimal times.

* **The Company Brain tracks what works:** Every post’s performance feeds back into the system. Characters evolve their style, tone, and content mix based on real data.

* **Cross-character coordination:** Multiple characters can reference each other, create collaborative content, or target different segments of the same funnel, all coordinated via A2A protocol.

# **2\. The AI Character Factory**

The Character Factory is where founders create, configure, and deploy AI-generated virtual influencers. Each character is a complete persona with visual identity, voice, personality, content style, and platform strategy.

## **2.1 Character Creation Pipeline**

**Step 1: Persona Design**

The founder provides high-level direction; the CharacterDesignAgent fills in the rest:

| Input | Example | Agent Enhancement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Target audience | Gen Z women interested in wellness | Generates demographic psychographic profile, platform preferences, content consumption patterns |
| Brand personality | Friendly, slightly sarcastic, body-positive | Creates full personality matrix: humor style, vocabulary level, emoji usage, response patterns, taboo topics |
| Visual direction | Asian-American, 20s, streetwear aesthetic | Generates 10 reference images via Nano Banana Pro for founder selection. Ensures character consistency seed is locked. |
| Voice direction | Warm, conversational, slight vocal fry | Generates 5 voice samples via ElevenLabs. Founder selects. Voice ID is locked for all future content. |
| Platform focus | TikTok primary, Instagram secondary | Determines content format ratios, posting cadence, engagement tactics per platform |
| Product/app to promote | Yokaizen wellness app | Designs content funnel: awareness → interest → desire → action sequences per platform |

**Step 2: Visual Identity Generation**

The visual pipeline uses multiple AI tools in sequence to create a complete, consistent character:

1. **Base Character Generation (Nano Banana Pro):** Generate the character’s “hero shot”, a high-quality portrait that establishes their face, body type, skin tone, hair style, and base aesthetic. Nano Banana Pro excels here because of its character consistency across edits. This image becomes the “identity anchor” for all future content.

2. **Pose/Scene Library (Nano Banana Pro \+ Kling):** Using the identity anchor, generate 50+ scene variations: character at a coffee shop, at the gym, taking a selfie, laughing with friends, holding a product, working at a desk. Nano Banana’s multi-image fusion ensures face consistency across all scenes.

3. **Video Avatar Setup (Kling AI Avatar):** Upload the identity anchor to Kling AI to create the talking avatar model. This enables the character to “speak” in UGC-style videos with accurate lip sync, natural gestures, and emotional expressions. Kling supports 1080p output at 48fps.

4. **Voice Cloning (ElevenLabs):** Create or clone a voice that matches the character’s persona. Configure emotional range, pacing, and accent. The voice ID is stored in the Character Vault for all future video generation.

5. **B-Roll Library (Veo 3.1 / Sora 2 / Kling Video):** Generate supplementary video footage: lifestyle scenes, product demos, reaction shots, transitions. These are cut into UGC-style videos by the VideoProducerAgent to create scroll-stopping content.

**Step 3: Character DNA Document**

Every character gets a DNA document (stored in Company Brain) that every agent references when creating content for that character:

## **4.3 Cross-Platform Content Adaptation**

Content is never simply cross-posted. Each platform requires native formatting. The ContentStrategyAgent handles adaptation:

| Original | TikTok Adaptation | Instagram Adaptation | Twitter Adaptation | LinkedIn Adaptation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 60sec UGC video | Native: trending sound, fast cuts, text overlay, 9:16 | Reel: no TikTok watermark, different caption \+ hashtags, quieter CTA | 30sec cut \+ hot take caption, or still frame \+ thread | Professional reframe: key insight as text post \+ 30sec clip |
| Personal story thread | Storytime TikTok: talking head \+ B-roll | Carousel: 1 idea per slide, swipe CTA | Native thread: hook → story → lesson → CTA | Long-form narrative post with professional lesson |

| Trending reaction | Duet/stitch format with trending sound | Story reaction with poll | Quote tweet with character take | Skip unless professionally relevant |

## **4.4 Engagement Automation**

The SocialMediaAgent doesn’t just post; it actively engages to build the character’s community:

* **Comment replies:** On every post, the agent monitors incoming comments and generates character-voice replies for the first 50 comments. Prioritizes comments with questions or high engagement potential. Detects and flags trolls without engaging.

* **Strategic engagement:** The agent identifies 20-30 high-reach accounts in the character’s niche and leaves thoughtful, valuable comments on their posts daily. This drives discovery through comment sections, a proven organic growth tactic on TikTok and Instagram.

* **DM automation:** For common DM patterns ("What app is that?", "How do I get started?"), the agent generates character-voice responses with personalized links. Complex DMs are flagged for human review.

* **Collaboration detection:** The ViralGrowthAgent identifies potential collaboration opportunities (other creators in the niche, trending challenges to participate in) and either auto-generates collaborative content or escalates to the founder.

# **5\. The Viral Growth Engine**

Going viral isn’t luck; it’s pattern recognition \+ timing \+ volume. The Viral Growth Engine systematizes this process.

## **5.1 Viral Pattern Detection**

The ViralGrowthAgent runs a continuous analysis loop on every heartbeat:

1. **Trending Sound/Audio Analysis (TikTok \+ Reels):** Monitor the TikTok trending sounds API and Instagram’s trending audio. Detect sounds in their early growth phase (1-10K uses) before they peak. Score relevance to character’s niche. Auto-generate script using the trending sound within 2 hours of detection.

2. **Format Trending Detection:** Identify emerging content formats (new transition styles, POV structures, caption trends). The agent monitors the top 100 creators in the character’s niche and detects when 3+ of them adopt a new format within 48 hours.

3. **Hashtag Velocity Tracking:** Track hashtag growth rates, not just volume. A hashtag growing 500%/day with 10K posts is more valuable than a static hashtag with 10M posts. The agent maintains a live leaderboard of high-velocity relevant hashtags.

4. **Cross-Platform Trend Bridging:** Detect trends that start on one platform and are about to jump to another (e.g., Twitter meme about to hit TikTok). Early cross-platform bridging is a proven virality strategy.

## **5.2 The Virality Formula**

Every piece of content is scored before publishing on a predicted virality index:

| Factor | Weight | Measurement | Optimization Lever |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Hook strength (first 1.5 sec) | 30% | Historical data: retention rate at 1.5 sec for similar hooks | A/B test 3 hook variants per video; publish the predicted winner |
| Trend alignment | 25% | Trending sound/format/hashtag velocity score at time of posting | Only publish trend-aligned content within 24 hours of trend detection |
| Emotional trigger | 20% | Sentiment analysis of script: surprise, humor, relatability, controversy | ContentStrategyAgent optimizes scripts for target emotion per funnel stage |
| Posting time | 15% | ML model trained on character’s historical performance by time/day | SocialMediaAgent auto-schedules to predicted optimal window |
| Visual quality | 10% | Technical quality score \+ aesthetic consistency with character brand | GraphicDesignAgent enforces visual standards and character consistency |

## **5.3 Multi-Character Strategy**

The real power emerges when running multiple characters simultaneously. Each targets a different audience segment but funnels to the same product:

| Character | Platform Focus | Target Segment | Content Angle | Funnel Role |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| @MikaWellness | TikTok \+ Instagram | Gen Z women, anxiety/wellness | Personal stories, mood tracking, self-care routines | Emotional connection → app install |
| @DrKaiMind | LinkedIn \+ Twitter | Professionals 30-45, burnout/productivity | Research-backed insights, workplace mental health data | Authority → enterprise pilot interest |
| @PixelZenGaming | TikTok \+ YouTube Shorts | Gen Z gamers, stress relief | Gaming meets mindfulness, anxiety in competitive gaming | Community building → app install |
| @NanaHealthyLife | Instagram \+ TikTok | Millennial parents, family wellness | Kids’ emotional intelligence, family mindfulness | Trust building → family plan signup |
| @TechBroRecovery | Twitter \+ TikTok | Tech workers, ironic/meme-driven | Satirical take on hustle culture, burnout recovery | Viral awareness → curiosity → install |

Cross-character interactions amplify reach further:

* **@MikaWellness duets @PixelZenGaming:** "When the gamer friend actually has good mental health advice" — cross-pollinates both audiences.

* **@DrKaiMind quotes @TechBroRecovery:** "I laughed but also this is backed by 3 studies" — adds authority to viral content.

* **@NanaHealthyLife references @MikaWellness:** "My daughter showed me this creator and honestly she’s right" — multigenerational funnel.

## **5.4 A/B Testing at Scale**

Every content piece is an experiment. The system generates multiple variants and tests them:

* **Hook variants:** For every video, generate 3 different opening hooks. Publish all 3 to different segments or at different times. Measure 1.5-second retention rate. The winning hook style feeds back into the ContentStrategyAgent’s skill set.

* **Caption variants:** For every post, generate 2 caption styles (question-based vs. statement-based, emoji-heavy vs. clean). Alternate and measure.

* **Posting time optimization:** The DataAnalystAgent maintains a per-character, per-platform heatmap of engagement by hour and day. The SocialMediaAgent schedules based on predicted peaks, which evolve weekly.

* **Character voice evolution:** If a character’s sarcastic tweets outperform their earnest ones by 3x, the ContentStrategyAgent automatically shifts the voice mix. Logged in Company Brain with rationale.

# **6\. Customer Acquisition Funnel**

Content without conversion is vanity metrics. Every character’s content is mapped to a customer acquisition funnel that the agents actively optimize.

## **6.1 The AIDA Funnel per Character**

| Stage | Content Types | Metrics | Agent Actions | Conversion Target |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Awareness (Top) | Trending videos, viral memes, hot takes, relatable content | Views, reach, impressions, follower growth rate | ViralGrowthAgent maximizes distribution; SocialMediaAgent drives engagement | 10K+ views per post average |
| Interest (Mid-Top) | Educational content, how-tos, personal stories, behind-the-scenes | Watch time, saves, shares, profile visits | ContentStrategyAgent deepens value; SEOAgent optimizes discoverability | 15% save rate, 5% share rate |
| Desire (Mid-Bottom) | Product integration, screen recordings, testimonials, before/after | Link clicks, bio visits, swipe-ups, DM inquiries | SalesAutomationAgent adds CTA optimization; EmailMarketingAgent captures leads | 3% link click rate |
| Action (Bottom) | Direct CTAs, limited offers, social proof, urgency triggers | App installs, signups, trial starts, purchases | CRMAgent tracks attribution; DataAnalystAgent measures CAC | 1-2% conversion from click to install |

## **6.2 Attribution Tracking**

Every character’s content generates trackable links using UTM parameters and deep links:

Link structure:

https://yokaizen.app.link/{character\_id}?utm\_source={platform}

  \&utm\_medium=organic\_social\&utm\_campaign={character\_name}

  \&utm\_content={content\_id}\&utm\_term={funnel\_stage}

The DataAnalystAgent aggregates attribution data across all characters and platforms into a unified Customer Acquisition Dashboard:

* **Per-Character CAC:** What does it cost to acquire a customer through each character? Include AI generation costs \+ API costs \+ server compute.

* **Per-Platform CAC:** Which platform delivers the cheapest conversions for each character?

* **Content-Type ROI:** Which content types drive the most conversions? Talking-head UGC vs. carousels vs. memes.

* **Funnel Drop-off Analysis:** Where in the AIDA funnel are we losing the most people? Which character/platform combination has the tightest funnel?

* **Time-to-Conversion:** How many touchpoints (content views) does a user typically need before converting? How does this vary by character?

## **6.3 Retargeting Integration**

Characters can be connected to paid advertising for retargeting high-intent users:

* **Pixel integration:** The character’s bio link pages include Meta Pixel, TikTok Pixel, and Twitter conversion tags. Users who click but don’t convert enter retargeting audiences.

* **Lookalike audiences:** The DataAnalystAgent generates lookalike audience specifications based on converting users’ demographics and behaviors. These feed into paid campaigns automatically.

* **UGC as ad creative:** Top-performing organic content from characters is automatically flagged by the ViralGrowthAgent as potential paid creative. It can be pushed into Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, or Twitter Ads with one-tap founder approval.

## **7.3 Budget Projection (Monthly)**

| Cost Category | Per Character/Month | 5 Characters/Month | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Nano Banana Pro (images) | $40-80 | $200-400 | \~1,000 images/month per character at $0.04-0.08/image |
| Kling AI Avatar (videos) | $150-300 | $750-1,500 | \~60 talking head videos/month per character |
| Veo 3.1 / Sora 2 (B-roll) | $50-150 | $250-750 | \~100 B-roll clips/month per character |
| ElevenLabs (voice) | $30-60 | $150-300 | \~50K characters of voiceover per character/month |
| Platform API costs | $0 | $0 | Organic posting via official APIs |
| LLM costs (agent operations) | $50-100 | $250-500 | Heartbeat \+ content generation \+ engagement replies |
| Server compute | $20-40 | $100-200 | Video assembly, processing, scheduling |
| TOTAL | $340-730 | $1,700-3,650 | Compare to: 1 human UGC creator \= $3,000-15,000/month |

At the high end ($3,650/month for 5 autonomous characters), this system produces approximately 650+ pieces of content per month across 5 platforms. A human team producing equivalent volume would cost $30,000-75,000/month minimum.

# **8\. Safety, Ethics & Compliance**

AI-generated characters operating autonomously on social media carry real risks. This section defines the guardrails.

## **8.1 Transparency Requirements**

* **AI disclosure in bios:** Every character’s bio includes “AI-generated content creator” or equivalent disclosure. This is both ethical and increasingly required by platform policies.

* **No deception about identity:** Characters never claim to be human if directly asked. They can maintain their persona but must acknowledge being AI-created when confronted.

* **Content watermarking:** All AI-generated images include SynthID watermarking (built into Nano Banana Pro). Videos include metadata disclosure.

## **8.2 Content Safety Guardrails**

| Guardrail | Implementation | Escalation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| No medical claims | ContentStrategyAgent has hard rule: never diagnose, prescribe, or make specific health claims. "This helped me" is OK; "This will cure your anxiety" is blocked. | Auto-blocked \+ founder notification |
| No harmful content | All generated content passes through safety classifier before publishing. Checks for: self-harm references, dangerous advice, discrimination, harassment. | Auto-blocked \+ logged for review |
| Brand safety | Character’s Content Rules define taboo topics. Agent checks every post against these rules before publishing. | Auto-paused \+ founder review |
| Engagement safety | Comment replies never engage with trolls, political arguments, or sensitive topics. Agent detects and disengages. | Silence \+ optional block |
| Financial responsibility | Daily and monthly spend caps per character. Agent pauses content generation if budget exceeded. | Auto-pause \+ founder alert |
| Platform compliance | Agents monitor platform policy updates (via web scraping) and adjust content strategy accordingly | Founder briefing on policy changes |

## **8.3 Platform-Specific Compliance**

* **TikTok:** Follows TikTok’s AI-generated content policy. Uses their AI content label feature where available. Avoids content that simulates real people.

* **Instagram/Meta:** Complies with Meta’s AI transparency requirements. Uses AI content labels. Does not use AI to impersonate real individuals.

* **Twitter/X:** Follows X’s automation policies for posting frequency and engagement. Bot/AI label where applicable.

* **LinkedIn:** Follows LinkedIn’s terms of service regarding AI-generated content. Professional tone maintained. No spam engagement patterns.
