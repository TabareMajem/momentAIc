The question is good, but it's a common one. Make the question more specific or controversial to spark more engagement. Also, the 'LinkedIn Famous?' thought bubble is a bit cheesy and undermines the serious tone you're trying to establish.","V2: The hashtags are a bit generic. Consider more niche hashtags related to specific technologies or engineering challenges. Also, clarify the frequency of updates to manage expectations (e.g., 'I'll share weekly updates')."]}]}
