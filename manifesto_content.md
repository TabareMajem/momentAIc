**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
SaaS is dead.

You just don't know it yet.

Here's why your Notion, Hubspot, Slack, and 47 other subscriptions are about to become irrelevant 🧵👇

---

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**
The average founder manages 12+ SaaS tools.

They pay $2,000+/mo NOT for results — but for the PRIVILEGE of doing the work themselves.

CRM doesn't close deals.
Analytics doesn't make decisions.
Project management doesn't ship product.

YOU still do everything. The software just watches.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Shift)**
What if instead of buying software, you hired an elite team?

Not contractors. Not freelancers.

A synthetic C-suite that:
→ Debates strategy in a virtual War Room
→ Hunts leads on Reddit & Twitter while you sleep
→ Writes, designs, and deploys campaigns autonomously

That's not a SaaS tool. That's a workforce.

**Tweet 4 (The Product)**
We built MomentAIc.

50+ specialized AI agents.
One unified command center.

Your CFO agent tracks burn rate.
Your SDR agent cold-pitches CTOs at 3AM.
Your Content agent posts viral threads before you wake up.
Your QA agent audits your website every Sunday.

All of them report to YOU.

**Tweet 5 (The Numbers)**
The math is brutal:

→ A junior SDR costs $60K/yr and books 5 meetings/mo
→ Our Sales Hunter scans 10,000 signals/day for $39/mo
→ It never sleeps. Never calls in sick. Never asks for equity.

This isn't automation.
This is a paradigm shift.

---

**Tweet 6 (Social Proof / FOMO)**
We're in private beta with 500+ YC and VC-backed founders.

The waitlist is open, but access is gated.

We're not building for everyone.
We're building for founders who want to win.

**Title: The End of SaaS as We Know It**

I've been building software for over a decade. And I'm going to say something controversial:

**SaaS is dead.**

Not the technology. The model.

The average startup founder today manages 12+ subscriptions. CRM, analytics, email marketing, project management, support desk, billing, design tools — the list is endless. And here's the brutal truth: none of them actually DO the work.

You're paying $2,000+/month for the privilege of doing everything yourself. The software just watches.

**So we asked: what if software didn't just serve you — what if it worked FOR you?**

That question led us to build MomentAIc.

MomentAIc is not a SaaS tool. It's an Autonomous Business OS — a synthetic workforce of 50+ specialized AI agents that debate strategy, hunt leads, generate content, manage finances, and execute growth playbooks. Autonomously.

Here's what happens when you onboard:

🔹 A Sales Hunter agent scans Reddit, Twitter, and LinkedIn every hour for high-intent signals relevant to your business — and drafts hyper-personalized outreach.

🔹 A Content Agent discovers trending topics in your industry and auto-generates social posts, scheduled and published without you lifting a finger.

🔹 A CFO Agent tracks your burn rate, runway, and revenue metrics in real-time — alerting you before problems become crises.

🔹 A QA Agent audits your website every week for broken links, accessibility issues, and UX regressions.

🔹 A War Room where your AI agents literally debate the best strategy — and the winner gets auto-executed.

The math is simple: a junior SDR costs $60K/year and books maybe 5 meetings per month. Our Sales Hunter processes 10,000 signals per day for $39/month. It never sleeps. Never calls in sick. Never asks for equity.

**This isn't automation. This is a paradigm shift.**

We're currently in private beta with 500+ YC and VC-backed founders. Access is gated because we're not building for everyone — we're building for founders who want to win.

If you're tired of managing software and ready to let it manage itself, the waitlist is open:
